He remembered a festival from his childhood, filled with laughter and lights. Everyone danced under the stars, and he felt alive. \n\nThat night, he watched a firework burst above him, lighting up the sky. He closed his eyes, feeling the power of joy all around. The colors painted his dreams, filling him with hope. He wanted to catch that light and keep it forever. \n\nNow, as he stood in the fading light, he felt that same excitement. The stars began to twinkle, and he smiled. With a deep breath, he promised himself to bring joy to others, just like that magical night. The sky was his canvas, and he was ready to paint it with happiness.<|end_of_text|>"
